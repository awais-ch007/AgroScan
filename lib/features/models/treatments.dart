Soak dormant cuttings for 30 mins in hot water at about 50Â°C.
Combine with other methods due to variable effectiveness.

      chemicalControl: '''
Consider integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments.
Traditional wound protectants may not penetrate deep enough in dormant grapevine cuttings to affect fungi.
Focus on preventive practices as most effective for trunk diseases.
Dip vines into specialized waxes with plant growth regulators or fungicide-impregnated formulations.
Before grafting to encourage graft union callus development and inhibit fungal contamination.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy any infected leaves, twigs, or fruit.
Pruning: Prune trees to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves.
Copper Products: Apply copper-based fungicides or bactericides (e.g., copper hydroxide, copper sulfate) as protectants during wet seasons.
Citrus Oil Extracts: Use citrus oil extracts (e.g., Orange Guard, Citrusolve) as a contact fungicide.
Bacterial Antagonists: Use beneficial bacteria such as Pseudomonas fluorescens strain A506 or Pseudomonas syringae strain ESC-10 as sprays to compete with the canker-causing bacteria.
''',
      chemicalControl: '''
Consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments.
No effective control once citrus canker is detected.
Focus on preventive measures:
Clearing and destruction of fallen tree material is essential.
Minimize the effect of the disease through proactive actions.
Control citrus psyllids to limit disease damage.
Copper-based fungicides or bactericides can provide a barrier against infection.
However, they will not treat an existing infection.

Increase soil organic matter levels for improved soil structure and water/nutrient retention.
Add organic matter to soils through:
Manure
Compost
Peat
Nettle slag
Guano
Horn meal
Nitrolime
Nettle slag can be sprayed directly on the leaves for added benefits.
''',
      chemicalControl: '''
Use fertilizers containing nitrogen (N). - Examples: Urea, NPK, ammonium nitrate. - Consult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.
Further recommendations:
It is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to
optimize your crop production.
Best to apply nitrogen in multiple splits throughout the season.
-Do not apply if you are close to harvesting time.

Adopt an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments.
No fungicides fully effective at eradicating existing cankers.
Apply preventive fungicides before harvest to reduce bull's-eye rot during storage.

Captan-based fungicides
Mancozeb-based fungicides
Ziram-based fungicides
